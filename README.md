# IL6-Gene-Expression-Analysis-and-GSEA
This project analyzes gene expression datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to identify and quantify Interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression. It then uses this data to perform Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on samples with the highest and lowest IL-6 expression levels to discover associated biological pathways.
